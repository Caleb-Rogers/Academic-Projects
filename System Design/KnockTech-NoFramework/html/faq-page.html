        <h3> What is KnockTech </h3>
        <p> KnockTech is our revolutionary virtually-guided freestanding heavy bag. Unlike a typical punching bag, our product introduces technology that
            tracks your movement and hits, and uses the resulting data to formulate a routine that will provide smart workouts, gratifying routines, and
            entertaining boxing scenarios that combines your love of martial arts with the advanced world of technology today. </p>

        <h3> How does it work? </h3>
        <p> KnockTechâ€™s heavy bag contains sensors throughout the bag that can track where you are hitting, the power in which you are striking, and the
            direction of your throws. Using these sensors can determine whether your hits are jabs, hooks, uppercuts, haymakers, or elbows. Using this
            sensory technology can also help escort your sessions with guided workouts and simulated boxing matches. </p>

        <h3> Can you use it anywhere? </h3>
        <p> KnockTech can be connected anywhere from your laptop, your computer, your SmartTV, and even your phone! Audio will be provided from the base
            of the heavy bag, but the optimal use of this product is combining it with our developed connections to a nearby smart TV, phone, or computer. </p>

        <h3> What else can I get from the product? </h3>
        <p> Upgrading to our paid subscription will allow access to training sessions with pre-recorded trainers and will have social rooms in which you
            can train along with your friends, and even simulate boxing matches against them. A further opportunity of this software will allow training
            classes with a live trainer, or have one-on-one sessions with a personal trainer.  </p>
